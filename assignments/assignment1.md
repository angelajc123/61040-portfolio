# Assignment 1
## Domains
1. ***Connecting with Others over Art***:
    Art is one of the most universal languages. It connects people from all over the world and taps into the shared human experience. I am a huge art lover, whether it be music, movies, books, or TV shows. There are super large fandoms out there for these things, and I love talking to other people who love the media I love. I find it hard sometimes to find people who like the media as me, especially if it's something that is not super popular. 
    
2. ***Buying Clothes Online***:
    It has never been more convenient to buy clothes, and there's never been a time with more options. I shop for clothes a lot online, but I have difficulty finding clothes that will actually fit me in real life. I end up returning a lot of things. Additionally, the number of options is overwhelming, and I feel like I waste a lot of time scrolling. I would love a process that is more streamlined and leads to more pieces I really love in my closet..

3. ***Creating Music***:
    I love music. I sing, play the piano and guitar, and write my own songs. In my expereince, music production is really hard to learn, with complex interfaces that require time and money to navigate. I also would love to collaborate with more people with creating music, but I don't know that many people directly around me that make music.

4. **Getting Health Help**: connecting people with experts, scheduling appointments
5. **Learning New Skills**: making education more accessible and personalized
6. **Being More Sustainable**: helping people make sustainable choices
7. **Increasing Productivity**: tracking how you spend your time
8. **Eating Healthier**: misinformation around nutrition, tracking food intake
9. **Engaging in Local Communities**: being notified about community events
10. **Planning Travel**: connecting people with local experiences, organizing itineraries

## Problems
### Connecting with Others over Art:
1. ***Meaningful discussion around music***: lack of network for sharing rating and reviews of music

    I often times find songs that I really like and that I want to talk about to other people, but I don't know where to go. Sometimes I talk to my friends about it, but we all have different music tastes and they might not know the song or like it. I also love doing lyrical deep dives and also picking apart the song sonically and appreciating the artisty that goes into it. I would really like to share this passion for my favorite pieces of music with other people who feel similarly.

2. **Following artists**: missing new releases and updates from artists

    Tools like Spotify and Instagram already exist to notify people when artists are realeasing new stuff, and although the current system is a little disorganized, I don't think people care enough to move to a different platform

3. **Discovering new artists**: difficulty finding new artists that match personal tastes

    Similar to above, people do this through Spotify and social media. Could be done in a more organized way and less randomly, but a totally new platform for that would be hard to take off.

### Buying Clothes Online:
1. ***Finding clothes that fit***: size inconsistency and lack of try-on options

    I have a really hard time finding clothes that fit me in real life online. I often times find a piece that I really like online, but when I get it it doesn't fit quite right and then it is a huge hassel to go to the store and return it, or ship it back, which detracts from the convenience of online shopping. I think many people have a similar issue.

2. **Overwhelming product choice**: wasted time and energy on endless options

    Filters and reccommendation systems already exist, does not seems especially transformative.
3. **Unsustainable practices**: unable to identify sustainable brands
    
    I think price dominates most consumer decisions, so relatively few people would choose sustainability over affordability.

### Creating Music:
1. **Learning music production**: steep learning curve with complex software for beginners
    
    A real problem, but solving would likely require building an entirely new production system or extensive tutorials, which is too large of a scope.

2. ***Finding Music Collaborators***: lack of networks to connect with other creatives

    I love to write songs, but have a hard time with producing them. I also enjoy the song writing portion more, and would love to connect with other people who perhaps like the producing part more. I don't know anyone that produces music, but it would be great to connect with people who do so we can all play to our strengths and create something together.

3. **Getting feedback playing:** lessons are expensive, hard to get better at playing music on your own

    There is not really an incentive for professionals to provide their feedback for free, so feedback would have to be somewhat automated, which seems difficult to do well.

## Stakeholders
### Meaningful Discussion Around Music
1. Listeners – user who wants to share opinions, discuss songs, or explore interpretations.
2. Artists – creators who may want feedback, fan engagement, or promotion of their work.
3. Record Labels – companies that produce and distribute music.

Listeners feel isolated or frustrated if they cannot find spaces for meaningful discussion. Artists miss out on constructive engagement with fans, insights about how their music is received, and promotion of their work. Record labels miss out on promotion of their work.

### Finding Music Collaborators
1. Collaborators – users looking for other people to create music with.
2. Mentors – professionals who might connect students or guide collaborations.
3. Listeners – users who want to listen to new music

Collaborators suffer from inablility to be connected with other musicians and make music together. Mentors miss out on helping ametures improve, although may not be incentivized to help without compensation. Listeners miss out on new, innovative music, although may also not be incentivized enough to listen unless the music can be found easily.

### Difficulty Finding Clothes That Fit
1. Shoppers – individuals frustrated by inconsistent sizing or returns.
2. Stores – businesses affected by return rates, customer satisfaction, and lost sales.
3. Manufacturers – companies responsible for sizing standards and fit consistency across products.
4. Sustainability activists - individuals interested in increase sustainable practices, especially amongst consumer products.

Shoppers experience frustration, wasted time, and possible financial loss from buying the wrong size. Stores incur higher return costs, reduced customer loyalty, and operational inefficiencies, although may gain some revenue from customers who can't be bothered to return items. Manufacturers risk damage to their reputation if sizing is inconsistent, although may incur higher costs to keep the sizing consistent. Sustainable activits would support a product that decreases the number of returns and items that end up in landfills.
