Hi! I'm Angela, a senior at MIT studying computer science. I'm from Gainesville, Florida. I am particularly interested in the intersection between software and design, music, and AI.

Some fun facts about me:
1. I love to sing
2. I have an older brother and a younger sister
3. I can sing the ABCs backwards
